My ASWF development workbench in compliance to my [AYON-Development-Workbench](https://github.com/MustafaJafar/AYON-Development-Workbench). 
I use it to set up my workspace for developing ASWF projects.

This workbench is designed to group various ASWF projects into one workarea along with some automated VS Code tasks for mundane and repetitive tasks like building a project.

Currently, it only includes a few actions that I use when working with a MaterialX project.
